# Program to check if two numbers are equal

# Take input from the user
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Check if the numbers are equal
if num1 == num2:
    print("The numbers are equal.")
else:
    print("The numbers are not equal.")
    
#Explanation:

#input() is used to take numbers from the user.
#if num1 == num2 checks if both numbers are equal.
#else handles the case if they are not equal.
